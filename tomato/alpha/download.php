<p><b>Morgan2McClintock Translator Download</b></p>

<p><i>Requirements</i><br>
To run this translator on your own machine, it needs to have a functioning web server and the capacity to serve PHP files.  If you're running Mac OS X, you're in luck; your machine already has all of these.  If you're running Linux, you're also almost assuredly in luck as well.</p>

<p>If you want to run this software on Mac OS X, you need to do these two things first.  They're both quite easy.<br>

<a href="http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2002/01/04/apache_macosx_pt3.html">How to start PHP on Mac OS X</a></p>

<p>If you're running Linux or Windows, contact your local system administrator for assistance.  Running these scripts on Linux will be easy; on Windows, it will be much harder.</p>

<p>In order to run this software on your own machine, you'll need a set of files.  There are two ways to get them.</p>

<p>1. You can download a tar archive of the files (<a href="cmrn.tar">cmrn.tar</a>), put the .tar file in a directory by itself, switch to that directory, and execute the command "tar -xvf cmrn.tar".</p>

<p>2. You can download the files individually.  I'd recommend saving them all into a single directory by themselves.  I also recommend strongly <b>copying and pasting</b> the text files, as you'll run into much less trouble that way.<br>
<a href="index.phps">index.php</a> (the page that shows the basic input form; call the file index.php)<br>
<a href="data.phps">data.php</a> (the page that does all calculations; call it data.php)<br>
<a href="style.css">style.css</a> (this helps the other two pages to look nice and pretty)<br>
<a href="sidebar.jpg">sidebar.jpg</a> and <a href="topbar.jpg">topbar.jpg</a> (a pair of images to make it look nice and pretty)<br>
cM/cMC data files:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="cmrn1">cmrn1</a> <a href="cmrn2">cmrn2</a> <a href="cmrn3">cmrn3</a> <a href="cmrn4">cmrn4</a> <a href="cmrn5">cmrn5</a> <a href="cmrn6">cmrn6</a><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="cmrn7">cmrn7</a> <a href="cmrn8">cmrn8</a> <a href="cmrn9">cmrn9</a> <a href="cmrn10">cmrn10</a> <a href="cmrn11">cmrn11</a> <a href="cmrn12">cmrn12</a><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These files contain the actual cM/cMC maps in a format that can be read by the program.<br>

<p>Simply put all of these files in the same directory where the web server can access them and the program should work just fine.</p>
