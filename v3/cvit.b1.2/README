==============================
CViT - Chromosome Viewing Tool
==============================

01/18/11 - Release b1.2

CViT is a Perl script used to quickly generate images that show features on 
genomic sequence. It is intentionly simplistic and low-tech; there are limitless 
possibilities for how one might view such data and CViT is optimized for speed
and ease of use over high-tech features.

Input is one or more files in GFF3 format.
(see http://www.sequenceontology.org/gff3.shtml)
One of these files must contain records describing one or more "chromosomes" 
(which could represent a psuedomolecule, BAC, contig, linkage group, any sort 
of contiguous stretch of DNA, or even a protein structure). These "chromosomes" 
are the backbone that the features are placed on.

Output is a PNG image.

CViT can be wrapped in other Perl scripts to extend its capability, or called by 
web pages to generate on-demand images. For example, BLAST hits can be displayed 
on a whole-genome view and displayed in a web browser.

Most aspects of the image can be modified without touching the code. See the
ini file, config/cvit.ini.
