<p>This tool uses the <a href="https://www.maizegdb.org/data_center/RNmaps" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">maize Recombination Nodule map</a> (Anderson <i>et al.</i> <a href="http://www.genetics.org/cgi/content/full/165/2/849">2003</a> and <a href="http://www.genetics.org/cgi/content/full/166/4/1923">2004</a>) to calculate approximate chromosomal positions for loci given a genetic map for a single chromosome. To run the calculator on your own machine, visit the <a href="https://github.com/darwincam/Morgan2McClintock">download page</a>.</p>

<p><b>Releases:</b></p>
<p><b><a href="./v1/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maize Version 1.0</a></b> was reported in <a href="http://www.genetics.org/cgi/content/full/172/3/2007" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lawrence <i>et al.</i> 2006</a>, where information on the functionality and utility of the tool for maize is described.</p>
<p><b><a href="./v2/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maize Version 2.0</a></b>. The ability to translate from cytological to genetic maps has been added, the dataset for cytological coordinates has been increased in resolution (i.e., in Version 1.0 the Recombination Nodules dataset was only specific to a single cMC. Here the specificity has been increased to tenths of cMC, as reported in the Anderson et al. publications), and the "Genetic Map" dataset has been removed due to its inaccuracies at this level of resolution.</p>
<p><a href="./v3/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Maize Version 3.0</b></a> Includes visualization of the translation.</p>
<p><b><a href="./tomato/alpha/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tomato Alpha</a></b>. This version is identical to Maize Version 2.0, but uses tomato data instead of maize!</p>
<p><b>Upcoming:</b> Tomato chromosome images for the tomato translator, an improved method for scaling genetic outputs to integrate with existing genetic maps, and Morgan2McClintock for mouse!</p>
