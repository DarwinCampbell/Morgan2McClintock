# Morgan2McClintock Translator 

This is the source code for the Morgan2McClintock Translator hosted at <http://m2m.dill-picl.org/>.

This tool uses the maize Recombination Nodule map (Anderson et al. 2003 and 2004) to calculate approximate chromosomal positions for loci given a genetic map for a single chromosome. 

To install and run this code locally you will need a webserver capable of serving php installed. 

For v3, you will also need to be able to execute perl if you want to use the visualization functionality. In addition to perl, you will need to install GD and the perl-GD bindings.
