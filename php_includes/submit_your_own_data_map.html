<p><a name="note"></a><b>How To Submit Your Own Map Data</b>:<br>
    Your map data MUST include the following:<br>
    <ol>
        <li>Your map must consist of a number of lines.  Each line should start with the name of the locus, followed by a tab, followed by the centiMorgan value for that locus.</li>
        <li>The program assumes that the tip of the short arm is at 0.0 cM UNLESS you submit a locus with a cM value of less than zero.</li>
        <li>The program also assumes that the tip of the long arm is at the cM value of your highest submitted cM value.  So, if you believe that the tip is not exactly at this locus, you should add a tip1 locus at the end with the cM value of where you believe the tip to be.</li>
        <li>There must be ONE locus beginning with the characters "cent".  The program will assume that this is the centromere.</li>
    </ol>
